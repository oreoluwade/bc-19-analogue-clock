BASIC CREATION STEPS:

* The index.html contains the basic code for the User interface

* The style directory contains files that add to the functionality and beautification of the interface.

* Working scripts as well as obtained libraries are in the script directory.

* The ticking sound produced is sourced from the audio file in the sound directory.

* The images directory contains images used for the backgrounds.
