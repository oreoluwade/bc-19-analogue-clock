# Analogue-clock Display

Introduction

Timezones and offsets are important in the knowledge of exactly what time it is in a particular location. Hence the application.

It has the following features:

* Local Time display (Analogue and Digital).
* Timezone/Location change to determine time in zone.

TOOLS USED:
* HTML5, Javascript

Bootstrap was necessary for styling, jquery for querying the timezone library for zonenames and offset values.


The clock by default displays the local time. To get the time in another timezone, the user clicks on the select button 
for the dropdown menu, or otherwise types in the selected region to know the time there.

* The app is hosted on github pages here: https://oreoluwade.github.io/bc-20-analogue-clock/
